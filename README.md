Random Test

Think you have what it takes to beat Evasion? [OR "to evade your predators"?]
Sync your phones to the Evasion server to outfox your friends in an all-out multiplayer BATTLE - ROYALE!
In a style reminiscent of the popular maze game Labyrinth, play as the TARGET to [evade/outmaneuver] your adversaries as they navigate through the maze, or take upon the role of the CATCHERS and work together to nab the elusive TARGET before time runs out.


GAMEPLAY
Sync phones to server [something...]. The first person to join is automatically the TARGET. Everyone else will assume the role of CATCHER.
The goal of the TARGET is to evade capture of all enemies within the time limit, while the goal of the CATCHERS is to capture the TARGET.
Players move around by tilting their phones in the direction they want to move. Aiding the TARGET will be several hidden passageways through walls that only the TARGET can traverse.

FUTURE ADDITIONS
This game is subject to updates that include bug fixes along with new content and features. We hope to be able to transition from blocky, discrete movements of each player to smooth rolling depending on the tilt of each phone. We are also optimistic of utilizing more diverse libraries to create smoother and more vibrant graphics for the game.
