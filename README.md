Random Test

Think you have what it takes to beat Evasion? [OR "to evade your predators"?]
Sync your phones to the Evasion server to outfox your friends in an all-out multiplayer BATTLE - ROYALE!
In a style reminiscent of the popular maze game Labyrinth, play as the TARGET to [evade/outmaneuver] your adversaries as they navigate through the maze, or take upon the role of the CATCHERS and work together to nab the elusive TARGET before time runs out.


GAMEPLAY
Sync phones to server [something...]. The first person to join is automatically the TARGET.
